1- All the requested considerations have been applied (no continuous shift, no same day shift, equal working shifts, etc.).

2- I added availability time table to the "employee" data set to determine which employees are available each day (see “Employees.csv”).

3- I created a Skill-Level code for each employee (for highly skilled employees:2, for others:1). This is to have one supervisor in each shift along with less experienced staff (see “Employees.csv”). This is optional in the code, you can choose having supervisors in each shift or just random staff selection.

I have left some comments in the code to make it more readable. The outcome is in “Schedule.csv”. By changing staff availability or skill levels in “Employees.csv”, this schedule changes to the optimised version.
